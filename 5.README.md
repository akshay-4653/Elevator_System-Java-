## 📝 Project Overview

This project simulates the basic functionality of an *elevator system* using Java. It demonstrates real-time elevator operations such as moving between floors, handling multiple requests, and prioritizing directions. The simulation is executed via the *console interface* and showcases the use of *multi-threading* and *object-oriented programming principles*.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built to:
- Understand and implement *Java multi-threading*
- Simulate a *real-world elevator system* through code
- Practice *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*
- Enhance *problem-solving* and *real-time application* development skills
